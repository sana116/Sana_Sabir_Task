**Answers**

1. I have spent 1 hour 45 minutes to complete this task. If I had more time, I would improve the front end design by using a separate css file and frontend authentication.
2. If this code is actual part of an application, all CRUD operations would be done by using ajax(restful APIs) calls. Data will be stored after complete authentication and verification.
